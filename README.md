## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

### What I learned

Making forms can be fun and create a lot of opportunities to interact with the user. I know I tend to dislike filling out forms of any kind on a website, and I believe many feel the same. Making forms interactive can be means of breaking the monotony of filling out field after field. This is not my first time working with dynamic forms i have implemented similar solutions with vanilla JS. This project relies heavily on the `useState` hook in order to update the form information and determine validity.

```javascript
const input = { value: "", valid: false };
const [email, setEmail] = useState(input);
const [fName, setFName] = useState(input);
const [lName, setLName] = useState(input);
const [password, setPassword] = useState(input);
const [validForm, setValidForm] = useState(true);
```
By using and object in my state I am able to track validity of each individual input as well as its value separately from the form itself.

To check validity i took advantage of the html input type features and the js `checkValidity()` function.

```javascript
const isValid = (target) => {
    if (target.value.length && target.checkValidity()) {
      return true;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  };
}
```
